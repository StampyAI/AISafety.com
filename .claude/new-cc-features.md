• Changed large tool outputs to be persisted to disk instead of truncated, providing full output access via file references
• Changed `/plugins` installed tab to unify plugins and MCPs with scope-based grouping
• Deprecated Windows managed settings path `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json` - administrators should migrate to `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`
• [SDK] Changed minimum zod peer dependency to ^4.0.0
• [VSCode] Fixed usage display not updating after manual compact
