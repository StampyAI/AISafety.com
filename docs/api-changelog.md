# AISafety.com Data API Changelog

Consumers: breaking changes to a published version will be announced here before
they ship. Backwards-compatible additions (new fields, new endpoints) can happen
at any time.

## v1 (unreleased)

Initial release.

- 10 read-only collection endpoints under `/api/v1`: `communities`,
  `organizations`, `events`, `jobs`, `funding`, `courses`, `advisors`,
  `media-channels`, `founder-resources`, `projects`.
- Wrapped `{ data, meta }` envelope; `meta` carries count, license, attribution,
  source, and `generatedAt`.
- Query-param filtering (case-insensitive substring, comma for OR) plus free-text
  `q` search.
- Open access, no API key, CORS `*`, `GET`/`OPTIONS` only.
- Data licensed CC-BY-4.0.
- `GET /api/v1` index and `GET /api/v1/openapi.json` spec; human docs at
  `/developers`.
- New `events` endpoint normalizes the events table (previously only an Airtable
  iframe embed on the site).
