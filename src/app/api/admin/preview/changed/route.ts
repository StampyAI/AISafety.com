/*
  Change check for preview mode's auto-refresh.

  GET /api/admin/preview/changed?path=/funding
    → { changed: boolean, buildTime: <ISO | null> }

  Asks Airtable whether any record feeding that page was modified within the
  last CHANGE_WINDOW_MS, via LAST_MODIFIED_TIME() — the same mechanism
  /api/check-rebuild uses to trigger deploys. The preview banner polls this
  every few seconds and calls router.refresh() on changed:true.

  A fixed look-back window rather than a "since my last poll" cursor, on
  purpose. An edit made in the Airtable UI takes a moment to be saved and
  become visible to the API; a poll that ran in that moment saw nothing, and
  with a cursor it then moved past the edit for good (a title change on
  3 Sept 2026 was lost that way — the poll and the save shared the same
  second). With the window, every poll until the edit ages out reports it,
  so the page re-renders a couple of times, each from the newest data. A few
  redundant in-place refreshes beat a missed edit.

  `buildTime` is the BUILD_TIME of the deployment answering the poll — when
  it moves past the one the page rendered with, a rebuild has gone live and
  the banner refreshes so "public built X ago" starts over. For a page with
  no Airtable content, it reports no change.
