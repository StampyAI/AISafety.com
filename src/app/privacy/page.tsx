          <p className="color-teal-300 padding-bottom-40px">
            This site doesn&apos;t set cookies for visitors. The only cookie we
            use anywhere is the one our own team gets when signing in to the
            site&apos;s admin area. The site does keep two small things in your
            browser&apos;s own storage: your chatbot conversation, so it
            isn&apos;t lost as you move between pages (it&apos;s cleared when
            you close the tab), and the anonymous analytics ID described below,
            which you can switch off. Nothing in your browser is used for
            advertising or to track you across other sites – the things cookie
            banners exist to ask consent for – which is why there&apos;s no
            banner.
          </p>

          <h3 className="padding-bottom-16px">Analytics</h3>
          <p className="color-teal-300 padding-bottom-24px">
            We use two privacy-respecting tools to understand how the site is
            used (and therefore improve it). Matomo, running in cookieless mode,
            gives us anonymous, aggregated statistics like page views and
            referrers. Our own first-party analytics records page visits, clicks
            on listings and links, and when the chatbot gets opened; it stores a
            random ID in your browser&apos;s local storage so we can count
            unique visitors, but that ID is not tied to your name, email, or IP
            address, and it never follows you to other sites.
          </p>
          <p className="color-teal-300 padding-bottom-24px">
            If you&apos;d rather not be counted, you can switch analytics off
            for this browser. This also stops your chatbot conversations from
            being saved.

          <h3 className="padding-bottom-16px">The chatbot</h3>
          <p className="color-teal-300 padding-bottom-40px">
            The chatbot is powered by Claude, an AI model from Anthropic – your
            messages are sent to Anthropic to generate each reply, and Anthropic
            doesn&apos;t train its models on them. Conversations are saved so we
            can improve the chatbot – the messages, the page you were on, how
            you arrived at the site, and your approximate location (city and
            country, estimated from your IP address, which we don&apos;t keep).
            Conversations may be reviewed by the AISafety.com team and trusted
            partners, and we use Claude to summarize the common topics people
            ask about. You&apos;ll see a notice about this in the chat window
            before you type anything. Please don&apos;t share sensitive personal
            information in the chat, and if you&apos;d like a conversation
            deleted, contact us using the form below.
          </p>

          <h3 className="padding-bottom-16px">Services we rely on</h3>
          <p className="color-teal-300 padding-bottom-40px">
            The site runs on Vercel (hosting), Matomo Cloud (analytics),
            Airtable (our listings database, forms, and chatbot logs), Anthropic
            (Claude, the AI model behind the chatbot), and ipapi.co (the
            approximate-location lookup for chatbot conversations). Our
            newsletters are hosted on Substack – when you subscribe there,
            Substack&apos;s own privacy policy applies.

          <p className="color-teal-300 padding-bottom-40px">

            . Because our analytics is anonymous, a chatbot conversation is
            usually the only thing of yours we&apos;d be able to find – mention
            roughly when it happened and what it was about, and we&apos;ll
            delete it.
