// First-party analytics event store (server-side only).
//
// Two backends, chosen automatically at runtime:
//   • Production: Upstash Redis — the same instance the chatbot rate-limiter
//     already uses. Events are stored in one list per calendar month
//     (aisafety:analytics:events:2026-07, …), newest first, with a sorted set
//     indexing which months exist. Nothing is ever deleted: a dashboard query
//     reads only the months its date range touches, so reads stay fast and
//     bounded no matter how much history accumulates. (The store originally
//     kept a single list capped at 5,000 events, which silently deleted
//     everything older than ~10 days — including all of 20–30 June 2026, the
//     first stretch after launch. The migrate endpoint copied that list's
//     survivors into their month lists on 10 July 2026.)
//   • Local dev (no Redis env vars set): an append-only NDJSON file under
//     .analytics-dev/ so the whole loop works on a laptop without touching
//     production data.
//
// Aggregation happens per-query in JS over the raw events: this keeps storage
// simple, makes the dashboard fully date-range aware (every event carries a
// timestamp), and means dev and prod compute identically. If a single month
// ever outgrows a JS aggregation pass we'd add daily rollups on top.
