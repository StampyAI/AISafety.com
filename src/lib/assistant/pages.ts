    // The page's copy, essentially verbatim.
    purpose: `The annual AISafety.com hackathon. A four-day, in-person hackathon to improve the AI safety resource hub.
  When: Thursday 17th September – Sunday 20th September 2026.
  Where: CEEALAR (the EA Hotel) in Blackpool, England.
  Cost: Free, including accommodation and all meals. Travel in general isn't covered, but for very strong applicants it may be considered.
  Applications: CLOSED on 14 August 2026 (decisions by 21 August). We may still consider late applications from very strong candidates – the form on this page (asks for name, email, skills/experience, personal links, anything else) still accepts late applications, but no decision or decision date is promised. Don't tell people applications are open or encourage everyone to apply; do say that someone who thinks they'd be a very strong fit is welcome to submit a late application.
  Once a year, the core AISafety.com team gets together with a group of amazing volunteers and spends an extended weekend getting a bunch of stuff done to improve the site. We also do some relaxed fun activities between work sessions.
  Who we're looking for: Product managers and designers – to execute the vision for new projects, build out design mockups, conduct user research, offer consulting, and brainstorm product solutions. Project managers – to lead and organize project efforts and run sprints. Developers – to work with product managers, designers, and AI tools to bring some amazing new things to life. Connectors, people with an audience, and subject-matter experts – to help us with targeted community outreach, general outreach, social media, and to give takes to product managers and designers. Promotion people – to help us spread awareness of the site and each resource page in various ways, maybe including SEO. Anything else – just tell us how you can help!
  On the first day of the hackathon we will divide everyone into small teams by project (the project list: https://app.notion.com/p/15aaef8c3f9640018d6b256d39b4ee8a?pvs=21). Participants will get to decide which projects they work on and in what way they contribute. We're also open to new project suggestions.
  Why it's worth it: build your resume, gain career capital, and make connections (everyone at the EA hotel, beyond just our hackathon, is working on something high-impact – mostly AI safety); have fun beyond just the work – we'll set aside time each day for beach walks, games, etc.; help save the world!
  If you have any questions, please message Bryce on the AISafety.com Discord server at @bryceerobertson, or email bryceerobertson@gmail.com.`,
