// Shared, dependency-free helper for tagging a resource-page listing with the

/** Each listing's slot on its page, keyed by record id: the featured cards
 *  (if the page has them) are 'F<rank>'; everything else is numbered '1', '2',
 *  '3'… in display order. Pages without featured cards just get the numbered
 *  list. Pass items in the order they render so the slot matches what the
 *  visitor saw.
 *
 *  Pages with a featured queue (/events, /training) pass `featured` — the
 *  cards their row actually displays, in display order — since a queued
 *  backup (rank 3+) renders as a normal grid card and must get a grid
 *  number, not an F-slot. A queued entry is stamped with its rank; a random
 *  stand-in has no rank, so it's stamped with its position in the row, like
 *  any other featured card. Without `featured`, ranks 1 and 2 count as
 *  featured (the fixed-slot pages). */
